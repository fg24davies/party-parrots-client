## Welcome to Parrot Party!

This repository is for my Makers Academy final team project, created by [@louballantyne](https://github.com/louballantyne), [@cspoppuppy](https://github.com/cspoppuppy) and myself, which was completed over a 2 week period.
We created an iOS app to rehome tropical birds in the country. Potential adopters can view all available birds in a list (with photo of bird avi and by location, apply to adopt a bird and see when their application is approved.
Charities (who handle tropical bird adoption) can list a bird up for adoption, add the birds location, see potential applications and approve them.

### Motivation
The motivation for this project was to automate and make the current process of rehoming tropical birds less time consuming. As it is all done by charities and volunteers, the current clunky process of emailing and making phonecalls takes a lot of time. 
An app such as this could reduce this effort for charities.

### Tech Stack

The app is built with a MERN tech stack with React Native with the following libraries: AWS-SDK, Multer, Multer-S3, UUID. We used the MapQuest API for adding locations.

### User Experience

We also wanted our app to be visually pleasing and fun to use. The landing page is shown below. For a full demo and presentation of the project is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCYlOvstGc) (from 17min30s for 5 minutes)
