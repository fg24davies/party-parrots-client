```  
An iOS app for listing and adopting tropical birds around the UK!
   
- Choose a bird from it's details and apply with a bio about yourself
- Choose a bird based on it's location
- List a bird for adoption: add a photo, bio and location!
- See if your bird has any adoption applications and approve them
- Celebrate with a confetti animation when your adoption is approved!
   
```

Makers Academy final team project, created by [@louballantyne](https://github.com/louballantyne), [@cspoppuppy](https://github.com/cspoppuppy) and myself, which was completed over a 2 week period.

We created an iOS app to rehome tropical birds around the country. Potential adopters can view all available birds in a list (with photo of bird avi and by location, apply to adopt a bird and see when their application is approved.
Charities (who handle tropical bird adoption) can list a bird up for adoption, add the birds location, see potential applications and approve them.

### Motivation
The motivation for this project was to automate and make the current process of rehoming tropical birds less time consuming. As it is all done by charities and volunteers, the current clunky process of emailing and making phonecalls takes a lot of time. 
An app such as this could reduce this effort for charities. We also wanted our app to be visually pleasing and fun to use. For a full demo and presentation of the project is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCYlOvstGc) (from 17min30s for 5 minutes)
